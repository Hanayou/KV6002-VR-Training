# Running from the .zip folder
The .zip folder contains all of the source files, as well as a pre-built executable (.exe) for Windows.

This does not require you to have the Unreal Engine installed and should work as long as the .zip contents have been unzipped.

The .exe can be found by opening the '*KV6002VRTraining*' folder, opening the '*Windows*' folder, and running '*KV6002VRTraining.exe*'.

# Running from a cloned Git repository (requires Unreal Engine 5.1 to be installed):
**GitHub repository**: https://github.com/Hanayou/KV6002-VR-Training 

The git repository contains also source code and binaries to open the project in the Unreal Editor and to build it yourself.

> **Note** 
> To open/run/build the project when cloned you must have Unreal Engine 5.1 installed on your device.

> **Warning**
> Unreal Engine can be very performance heavy. A system with a dedicated graphics processor is highly recommended to achieve playable results.
